<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">In the four years between the last release of Wod:LOX 1.11
in September of 1999 and December 2003 the LOX mod waned along with the popularity of Quake 2 and eventually there were only 1 or 2
servers running LOX in any form on the Internet. Part of the problem, it seemed to me, was the stability and general crankyness
of LOX on both the Linux and Windows platforms. If only we could fix some of the unstable interactions of some of the features, like
the guided missles making player POV go nuts when they were intercepted by the angel of mercy, or the fact that decoys never worked right, or
the way the server would crash every couple of hours if you didn't have all the right features configured or certain weapons banned.<br>
<br>
If only...<br>
<br>
Finally, I decided after years of enjoying the mod and enduring all the vagaries and bugs and server crashes to actually get<br>
off my butt and do something about it. I had the LOX source code, a version that was purported to be LOX 1.11, in a ZIP archive.&nbsp;<br>
But what's this? I compile the code - and lo and behold it _says_ it's LOX 1.11 and runs just fine but where are the guided<br>
nukes and the guided darKMajick grenades? It turns out that the only remaining source archive of the LOX code was a version that
was numbered 1.11 but was something between 1.10 and 1.11 and it was missing a lot of features that existed in the LOX binaries that
were being distributed world wide. I had intended to make some minor bug fixes and some tweaks to the code here and there and just improve
it just a little bit and then sit back and enjoy the new game and watch everyone have a good time. Little did I know.<br>
<br>
As Dave described, LOX is mixture of WOD and lots of other cool features and weapons from other mods that everyone thought would
be cool to have in a really insanely funny mod. The result was some pretty weird interaction of those features and sometimes some
server-crashing incompatibilities. I come from a background in real-time systems and robotics where if the system crashes, really
bad things happen in the real world. I couldn't just let a few bugs remain un-smashed. My goal now is to make LOX as full-featured as possible
and to minimize the pain an admin has to endure to keep the server up and to make LOX as smooth and stable as I possibly could. So here is
the result of one year of effort, off and on, as I had time on weekends and in the evenings in my motel room during the week, (I travel a
lot in my job), finding bugs and cleaning up code and in general,&nbsp;<br>
just learning all the tricks I needed to learn about programming FPS games in C, without dispatchers and tasks and all the other neat things
that make programming real-time events a little easier. I won't bore you with the details of my learning
experience, but what started out being a few minor tweaks here and there became a full-on rewrite of
what has now become over 220 source files worth of code from a variety of authors coding to different standards and different objectives.
I broke a few things along the way, I fixed a few things, I added a few things and I think and hope that LOX is better than it was when
I started working on it. I haven't run out of bugs or ideas yet, there are still more versions yet to come with added features and weapons that
will hopefully make it even more fun.<br>
<br>
The first few LOX 1.12.x packages installed on top of existing WoD:LOX installations, so LOX 1.10 or 1.11 should be your starting point
since LOX versions 1.12.1 thru 1.12.4 are all merely DLL replacements. Beginning with LOX version 1.12.6 I am creating a full installation
ZIP file that will drop everything you need to play LOX into your Quake 2 installation. This ZIP file contains the LOX libraries for
Windows and for Linux and should be compatible with Windows 98, Windows NT 4.0, Windows XP, Fedora Core, Red Hat 9.0 and 9.1 with
other flavors of Linux yet to be tested. Some versions of Linux require the Quake 2 v3.21 code be built on or for the target
system, so Linux owners, you know what to do. Loxophilia, the WOS server that runs LOX for our clan is running Red Hat Enterprise
Linux using Quake 2, v3.21 built on RH9 and LOX code built on Fedora Core 1.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -5"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b><i>Foreword
and History of the Mod, By The Lopez</i></b><br>
<br>
Thank you for choosing my mod. This is truly one of the most weapon packed and
feature packed mods that has ever been written. It has no theme other than grab
a weapon and completely destroy your enemy. Please after you play it don't email
me to say well the mod sucks, it is just a combination of a bunch of different
mods. I already know that. We, the development team, have gone into a bunch of
different mods source codes and found which weapons&nbsp;
and features were the best.&nbsp; Knowing this information we code that code and
added it into ours. But originally this mod was not really a mod, it was a joke.
It was a joke on the part of Clan Lox. During a smoke break, after a night of
drinking and playing quake, a bunch of us started to say &quot;wow wouldn't it
be cool to have a chain Railgun in WOD?&quot; In my drunken stupor I said yeah
that would be cool. So the next morning I down- loaded the WoD code and started
to play around with it. We, Gametoken and myself created the original sweepers
that day, Superblaster, freezer, grenade, bazooka and railgun. We put this new
DLL onto our clan server, Monty's Meatgrinder, and started to kick peoples
butts. Then people started to get mad cause our DLL was messing up the&nbsp;
stats. We changed the name of our mod from just WoD to WoD:LOX, Lethal Orifice
eXamination. At the time we only had one server up and the end of the school
year was drawing near. Then one day when I was going from WoD server to WoD
serve trying to get people to switch to WoD:LOX I met clan RAD. After a
butt-kicking on my part I told the people who were there about my mod and they
seemed interested.&nbsp; If I remember right it was Deathdawg and Papatick. I
think that was who was there from clan RAD. There might have been others but I
can't remember. So I showed them the mod and they liked them. They set up the
second of the WoD:LOX servers. It was because of their interest in the mod that
kept me wanting to develop the mod even further.&nbsp;
</font></p>

<p align="left" style="text-indent: -5"><font face="Arial" size="2">
After tearful goodbyes clan Lox went their separate ways for the summer. At home
I kept developing the mod, adding new weapons and features. But that was not the
only thing that I did. I put up the eight lox servers that have served use
faithfully since then. More and more people started to join our ranks as WoD:LOX
players.

===================<br>
Mod Version History<br>
===================<br>
1.10<br>
- RELEASED: WoD:LOX Server Configuration Tool. There is a link to the zip file
at the<br>
&nbsp; wodlox download page. This should help server admins configure their
wod:lox servers.<br>
- Added the Explosive Chaingun. Hehehehe this should make the game a little bit
more<br>
&nbsp; interesting. Fires explosive bullets rather than than the regular shells.<br>
- Added the Explosive Shotgun weapons. Each one of the shell weapons now have an
<br>
&nbsp; explosive alternate. People should get a kick out of the new Explosive
Streetsweeper.<br>
- Got the Linux version to compile, but I am still getting Segmentation Faults
right<br>
&nbsp; after someone connects. I am trying to get it to work. Another problem
that we had<br>
&nbsp; was that the Torture Chamber was making it so the Linux binary would not
load up.<br>
&nbsp; I had to take it out of both versions. Hopefully I can get it to work
sometime in<br>
&nbsp; the future.<br>
- It works, it works. After getting reports that the explosive and detonate
command didn't<br>
&nbsp; work I was bummed. I thought that I had fixed the bloody thing. Then I
noticed that<br>
&nbsp; when the explosive killed you, when you died, if you had an explosive out
it had <br>
&nbsp; to be detonated, thus causing damage to you, killing you, and so on and
so on. You<br>
&nbsp; can see how this could cause a server to crash, well this is fixed now.<br>
- I added rocket armor and grenade armor. Though this does not protect you from
the<br>
&nbsp; grenade or rocket splash damage.<br>
- Fixed up the angel of death to fire the new weapons<br>
- Fixed up the trackers to fire the new weapons<br>
- Changed the Spiral Rocket Launcher, so when the rockets actually hit they will
act<br>
&nbsp; like the flame rockets.<br>
- added variables for revenge factor, revengeaward and highfraggeraward.
Hopefully <br>
&nbsp; this should motivate people to use this feature of the mod.<br>
- added the daynight server variable. It is set by default to 13 minutes to
change it<br>
&nbsp; just add the line 'set nightdaytime &lt;time in min&gt;' where &lt;time
in min&gt; is the number<br>
&nbsp; of minutes you want the cycle to take. A cycle if you don't remember is
the time it<br>
&nbsp; takes for it to go from day -&gt; night -&gt; day.<br>
- changed the MOD messages for the explosive weapons.<br>
- Added 3 new commands that you guys will love. Well actually it is four
commands. The first<br>
&nbsp; of the commands is lbind. This command is needed for the following three
commands. <br>
&nbsp; onspawn, ondeath and onenemydeath. So if you can imagine these new
commands will be <br>
&nbsp; very useful. For instance you no longer will have to set up your HUD each
time after you<br>
&nbsp; die. Instead you can do 'lbind onspawn &quot;&lt;commands&gt;&quot; ' the
commands have to be in quotes else<br>
&nbsp; it won't work properly. Enjoy.<br>
- Added the Sticky Grenadesweeper<br>
- Added Explosive Machinegun<br>
- Added and fixed the High Fragger Ghost feature. Bascially what this does is
create a ghost like<br>
&nbsp; effect above the person with the most frags.<br>
- Added the positron grenade<br>
- Added the Kaminit gun. Basically when you hit someone with this weapon it will
initiate their kamakaze<br>
&nbsp; sequence.<br>
- Added the Wall Piercing Railgun, so all of you who like hiding behind walls,
beware.<br>
- Added Angel Of Unfreeze per request of many people. I know that the Angel of
Frost can become <br>
&nbsp; overly annoying when used. Well here is my answer to it.<br>
- WoD:LOX Linux finally compiled and worked fine. Thank you gametoken, sigh.<br>
<br>
1.09<br>
- I have fixed the explosives bug as well as I can. There is a server-client
timing <br>
&nbsp; issue that the ID Software code has. I really don't know what to do.<br>
- After play testing the trackers with some people we noticed that the rate of
fire<br>
&nbsp; has been too fast. I slowed the rate of fire down. Plus the trackers now
track a <br>
&nbsp; lot better.<br>
- All the sweepers actually work correctly now. After tweaking their code a bit
I <br>
&nbsp; have been able to make them work like the streetsweeper works. As long as
you hold<br>
&nbsp; down the attack button down you will fire. <br>
- If you have the sweeperfiremode enabled and have the attack button pressed
while <br>
&nbsp; firing the attack button down you run the risk of having your sweeper
explode. You<br>
&nbsp; have been warned.<br>
- I have gotten sick of people asking me &quot;How do I do ....&quot; you can
finish the rest.<br>
&nbsp; Well as a solution to this I have implemented a in WoD:LOX help system.
Ask it a <br>
&nbsp; question about a feature, command or person and you will get a short
description <br>
&nbsp; and the command to it. I hope this helps people.<br>
&nbsp; 08-14-99, wow I finished the commands part of the in game online manual.
I am going<br>
&nbsp; to start on the weapons parts of it. It is looking really good.<br>
&nbsp; 08-15-99, The weapons part of the in game online manual is done now.<br>
- Modified the scanner so it can be relocatible. Basically if you type in the
console<br>
&nbsp; Scanner &lt;xpos&gt; &lt;ypos&gt;, you will be able to determine the
location of the scanner.<br>
&nbsp; Try it, it is cool.<br>
- Added Holo commands, now you can drop a decoy BFG, invulnerability and quad
damage.<br>
&nbsp; You can use these to lure people out in the open. WoD:LOX sould be a
little bit more<br>
&nbsp; interesting now. Hehehehe.<br>
- I fixed the Trackers so they actually shoot the correct ammo now. So if you
drop a<br>
&nbsp; tracker while using the blaster, it will shot blaster shots. Trackers can
now be<br>
&nbsp; destroyed by shooting them.<br>
&nbsp; I also toned down the trackers. You can only shoot 3 of them out and when
they shoot<br>
&nbsp; their ammo they will shot a lot slower.<br>
- Added the time command. Now you can see what time it is, useful for those long
nights<br>
&nbsp; of fragging.<br>
- Fixed the invisibility command. After playtesting it was noticed that you
could be<br>
&nbsp; invisible and cloaked at the same time.<br>
- Toned down the grenade and bazooka sweepers. After play testing it was noticed
that<br>
&nbsp; excessive use of these sweepers made the servers crash.<br>
- Added the Slug armor. This armor makes the player absorb the damage that any
of the<br>
&nbsp; Slug weapons do.<br>
- Added the Cell Armor. Same as Slug armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that<br>
&nbsp; use cells.<br>
- Added the Shell Armor. Same as Shell armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that<br>
&nbsp; use shells.<br>
- Added the Bullet Armor. Same as Bullet armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that<br>
&nbsp; use bullets.<br>
- Added the sonic railgun. Shoots when you release the attack button. The longer
you hold<br>
&nbsp; the attack button down the more damage it does.<br>
- Added the Spiral Rocket Launcher. Shoots 3 rockets. The one main rocket in the
center<br>
&nbsp; with two outer rockets spiralling around the main one.<br>
<br>
1.08<br>
- After getting reports that the explosives were not working correctly in the
mods<br>
&nbsp; I desided to investigate the problem. And low and behold there was a
problem in <br>
&nbsp; the code. I fixed the bug, in the process I created a second command
called detonate.<br>
&nbsp; This is the command that you use to detonate a explosive from now on.<br>
- Added the Durg gun, with this weapon you can make your opponents lose their
current <br>
&nbsp; weapon.<br>
- Added the Durgsweeper.<br>
- Added the Angel of Revenge. <br>
- Added the Double Impact weapon, shoots two grenades verses the one for the
grenade<br>
&nbsp; launcher.<br>
- Added the Tracker, WoD:LOX style turrents.<br>
- Added the FBFG.<br>
- Added Disruptor from the Wyrm ][ code. With that code in place I will be able
to use<br>
&nbsp; its special effects to create some new weapons.<br>
- Added the Vacuum Maker. This should make the game more interesting because now
you are<br>
&nbsp; able to pull people and objects to you.<br>
- Added the infamous energy vortex<br>
- Added a time variable for the night-day system<br>
<br>
1.06-1.07<br>
- Well I have been avoiding this for way to long so here is the lowdown on<br>
&nbsp; the new version of the mod. We have got 13 servers up and over 1000
playing<br>
&nbsp; the mod now.<br>
- Added three new angels, Angel Of Horror, Angel of Blindness and Angel of Flame<br>
- Added a new grenade, Blindness Grenade, based on the Angel of Blindness<br>
- Added the mace weapon, again based on the Angel of Blindness<br>
- Fixed the day-night system. It seems like the day-night system was still <br>
&nbsp; not working together. Basically the system should have reset itself on <br>
&nbsp; each level load, but it did not. Well Now it does.<br>
- Added the ver command<br>
- Added the logplayers command. This command will display the players names, ip <br>
&nbsp; addresses, current weapon and current map. This is to help weed out the
name<br>
&nbsp; spoofers.<br>
- Added the Airstrike command. <br>
- Added the Flamesweeper, new type of flamethrower.<br>
- Added the chunkgun, new type of sweeper based on the Angel of plague. You<br>
&nbsp; can all thank Z'ha'dum for this one. <br>
- Fixed the new angel code to make it more efficient and concice.<br>
- Created a workaround for the Index Overflow error<br>
- Started to work on two new angels, Angel of Evil and Angel of Revenge.<br>
1.05<br>
- Fixed the annoying Angel Of Frost bug where if two people were playing<br>
&nbsp; with the angel of frost active and one person froze the other person, <br>
