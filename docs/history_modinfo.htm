<b>Mod Version History<br></b>
===================<br>
<br>
<b>1.10<br></b>
<br>
- RELEASED: WoD:LOX Server Configuration Tool. There is a link to the zip file
at the wodlox download page. This should help server admins configure their
wod:lox servers.<br>
- Added the Explosive Chaingun. Hehehehe this should make the game a little bit
more interesting. Fires explosive bullets rather than than the regular shells.<br>
- Added the Explosive Shotgun weapons. Each one of the shell weapons now have an
explosive alternate. People should get a kick out of the new Explosive Streetsweeper.<br>
- Got the Linux version to compile, but I am still getting Segmentation Faults
right after someone connects. I am trying to get it to work. Another problem
that we had was that the Torture Chamber was making it so the Linux binary would not
load up. I had to take it out of both versions. Hopefully I can get it to work
sometime in the future.<br>
- It works, it works. After getting reports that the explosive and detonate
command didn't work I was bummed. I thought that I had fixed the bloody thing. Then I
noticed that when the explosive killed you, when you died, if you had an explosive out
it had to be detonated, thus causing damage to you, killing you, and so on and
so on. You can see how this could cause a server to crash, well this is fixed now.<br>
- I added rocket armor and grenade armor. Though this does not protect you from
the grenade or rocket splash damage.<br>
- Fixed up the angel of death to fire the new weapons<br>
- Fixed up the trackers to fire the new weapons<br>
- Changed the Spiral Rocket Launcher, so when the rockets actually hit they will
act like the flame rockets.<br>
- added variables for revenge factor, revengeaward and highfraggeraward.
Hopefully this should motivate people to use this feature of the mod.<br>
- added the daynight server variable. It is set by default to 13 minutes. To
change it just add the line 'set nightdaytime &lt;time in min&gt;' where &lt;time
in min&gt; is the number of minutes you want the cycle to take. A cycle if you don't 
remember is the time it takes for it to go from day -&gt; night -&gt; day.<br>
- changed the MOD messages for the explosive weapons.<br>
- Added 3 new commands that you guys will love. Well actually it is four
commands. The first of the commands is lbind. This command is needed for the following three
commands: onspawn, ondeath and onenemydeath. So if you can imagine these new
commands will be very useful. For instance you no longer will have to set up your HUD each
time after you die. Instead you can do 'lbind onspawn &quot;&lt;commands&gt;&quot; ' the
commands have to be in quotes else it won't work properly. Enjoy.<br>
- Added the Sticky Grenadesweeper<br>
- Added Explosive Machinegun<br>
- Added and fixed the High Fragger Ghost feature. Bascially what this does is
create a ghost like<br>
 effect above the person with the most frags.<br>
- Added the positron grenade<br>
- Added the Kaminit gun. Basically when you hit someone with this weapon it will
initiate their kamakaze sequence.<br>
- Added the Wall Piercing Railgun, so all of you who like hiding behind walls,
beware.<br>
- Added Angel Of Unfreeze per request of many people. I know that the Angel of
Frost can become overly annoying when used. Well here is my answer to it.<br>
- WoD:LOX Linux finally compiled and worked fine. Thank you gametoken, sigh.<br>
<br>
<b>1.09</b><br>
<br>
- I have fixed the explosives bug as well as I can. There is a server-client
timing issue that the ID Software code has. I really don't know what to do.<br>
- After play testing the trackers with some people we noticed that the rate of
fire has been too fast. I slowed the rate of fire down. Plus the trackers now
track a lot better.<br>
- All the sweepers actually work correctly now. After tweaking their code a bit
I have been able to make them work like the streetsweeper works. As long as
you hold down the attack button down you will fire. <br>
- If you have the sweeperfiremode enabled and have the attack button pressed
while firing the attack button down you run the risk of having your sweeper
explode. You have been warned.<br>
- I have gotten sick of people asking me &quot;How do I do ....&quot; you can
finish the rest.<br>
 Well as a solution to this I have implemented a in WoD:LOX help system.
Ask it a question about a feature, command or person and you will get a short
description and the command to it. I hope this helps people.<br>

08-14-99, wow I finished the commands part of the in game online manual.
I am going to start on the weapons parts of it. It is looking really good.<br>

08-15-99, The weapons part of the in game online manual is done now.<br>

- Modified the scanner so it can be relocatible. Basically if you type in the
console Scanner &lt;xpos&gt; &lt;ypos&gt;, you will be able to determine the
location of the scanner. Try it, it is cool.<br>
- Added Holo commands, now you can drop a decoy BFG, invulnerability and quad
damage. You can use these to lure people out in the open. WoD:LOX sould be a
little bit more interesting now. Hehehehe.<br>
- I fixed the Trackers so they actually shoot the correct ammo now. So if you
drop a tracker while using the blaster, it will shot blaster shots. Trackers can
now be destroyed by shooting them. I also toned down the trackers. You can only 
shoot 3 of them out and when they shoot their ammo they will shot a lot slower.<br>
- Added the time command. Now you can see what time it is, useful for those long
nights of fragging.<br>
- Fixed the invisibility command. After playtesting it was noticed that you
could be invisible and cloaked at the same time.<br>
- Toned down the grenade and bazooka sweepers. After play testing it was noticed
that excessive use of these sweepers made the servers crash.<br>
- Added the Slug armor. This armor makes the player absorb the damage that any
of the Slug weapons do.<br>
- Added the Cell Armor. Same as Slug armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that use cells.<br>
- Added the Shell Armor. Same as Shell armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that use shells.<br>
- Added the Bullet Armor. Same as Bullet armor but absorbs the damage from any
weapons that use bullets.<br>
- Added the sonic railgun. Shoots when you release the attack button. The longer
you hold the attack button down the more damage it does.<br>
- Added the Spiral Rocket Launcher. Shoots 3 rockets. The one main rocket in the
center with two outer rockets spiralling around the main one.<br>
<br>
<b>1.08<br></b>
<br>
- After getting reports that the explosives were not working correctly in the
mods I desided to investigate the problem. And low and behold there was a
problem in the code. I fixed the bug, in the process I created a second command
called detonate. This is the command that you use to detonate a explosive from now on.<br>
- Added the Durg gun, with this weapon you can make your opponents lose their
current weapon.<br>
- Added the Durgsweeper.<br>
- Added the Angel of Revenge. <br>
- Added the Double Impact weapon, shoots two grenades verses the one for the
grenade launcher.<br>
- Added the Tracker, WoD:LOX style turrents.<br>
- Added the FBFG.<br>
- Added Disruptor from the Wyrm ][ code. With that code in place I will be able
to use its special effects to create some new weapons.<br>
- Added the Vacuum Maker. This should make the game more interesting because now
you are able to pull people and objects to you.<br>
- Added the infamous energy vortex<br>
- Added a time variable for the night-day system<br>
<br>
<b>1.06-1.07<br></b>
<br>
- Well I have been avoiding this for way to long so here is the lowdown on<br>
 the new version of the mod. We have got 13 servers up and over 1000
playing the mod now.<br>
- Added three new angels, Angel Of Horror, Angel of Blindness and Angel of Flame<br>
- Added a new grenade, Blindness Grenade, based on the Angel of Blindness<br>
- Added the mace weapon, again based on the Angel of Blindness<br>
- Fixed the day-night system. It seems like the day-night system was still
not working together. Basically the system should have reset itself on
each level load, but it did not. Well Now it does.<br>
- Added the ver command<br>
- Added the logplayers command. This command will display the players names, ip
addresses, current weapon and current map. This is to help weed out the name spoofers.<br>
- Added the Airstrike command. <br>
- Added the Flamesweeper, new type of flamethrower.<br>
- Added the chunkgun, new type of sweeper based on the Angel of plague. You
can all thank Z'ha'dum for this one. <br>

person's angel could still freeze people.<br>

lighting, the new level would start normal, then all of a sudden change
