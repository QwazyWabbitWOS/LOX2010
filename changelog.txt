Changes made, gotchas, configuration tricks.

QwazyWabbit

12/12/2003 - P_client.c(731) changed "reaped" to "ripped" and took out extra spaces 
             in the text.

12/21/2003 - Fixed decoy bug causing homer rockets, trackers and skippers to crash server.

12/30/2003 - Fixed decoy bug.  Skin of decoy was always skin of client 0, the first client
             to connect to the server.  Modified g_monster.c, monster_start().  The 
             decoy spawn code was setting the proper self->skinnum, but monster_start() 
             was setting it to 0. Decoys now have the skin of their owners.
                          
12/31/2003 - Fixed hook bug. Grapple and chain lingered if player disconnected with 
             hook engaged.

01/10/2004 - Limit number of deployable lasertrips to 3. (Now a variable, see 1/17/04 below.)
             Added lasertrip member to gclient_s in g_local.h.  

01/10/2004 - Floating mines (g_weapon.c), limit is 7.  TODO: Test mines, check for bugs.
             Essentially no code change so far.  Oops, no floating mine launcher object?
             FML works in cheat mode (give all) but how to pick up launcher in normal game?

01/15/2004 - Debugged lasertrip limiting.  Tested OK with downlevel client (1.11) and 
             mod-less Mac client, no bugs.

01/15/2004 - New cvar, debugmodels. Set it to 1 in server.cfg if you want console output of
             model information.  Now this can be turned off or on at runtime.

01/17/2004 - New cvars, max_trackers and max_lasertrips.  This allows server.cfg to set the
             maximum allowable trackers or laser tripwires a user can deploy.  
             New commands for config: set maxtrackers n and set maxlasertrips n.

01/18/2004 - Revisited debug model checking.  Do the check always in deathmatch dedicated 
             maplist mode as before but only print the messages if debugmodels is set.

01/20/2004 - Enabled BFG weapon in unlimited ammo mode.  See dmflags parsing in g_items.c.  
             Was a hack to disable them long time ago.  Need to make sure weapon banning 
             will work. This might take some work since banning BFG and FBFG will also 
             affect the vortex and other weps that depend on the BFG objects. This 
             complication is probably the reason for the original hack in the dmflags.  
             Note: Need to check wep select code and do selection based on weapban 
             and keep the bfg object, just don't allow its selection.

01/21/2004 - Deadman reports shortening gamename fixes nagging Info string length exceeded 
             message. This is coming from Info_SetValueForKey() in q_shared.c when the 
             server has to send the server information to a client like Gamespy. This 
             message is caused by the server detecting that it needs to send a big 
             frame to a client.  Threshold is 512 bytes. Max key/value size is 64 but 
             LOX sends a lot of extra server keys that other mods don't.
             Lay one or two proxy DLL's on top of it and you get lots of status info.

02/14/2004 - Added server configuration varable kami_frozen to allow clients
             to go kamikaze even if frozen.  Use "set kamifrozen 1" to allow.

03/07/2004 - Re-invented guided grenades.  Added g_weapon.h for interface into calling
             the g_weapon.c functions from within l_rockets.c. Added server configuration
             variable disruptor_trackers to allow trackers to be launched if you are 
             carrying disruptor.  Use set disruptortrackers 1 to allow them.

03/09/2004   Added time and timeleft/timeremaining commands.  Command "time" tells you 
             what time it is using _strtime().  Command "timeremaining" tells you how 
             many minutes are left in the match.

03/10/2004 - Changed gamename to shorter text. Removed revengereward, highfraggerreward 
             and sv_bestplayer from the CVAR_SERVERINFO class of variables.  This keeps 
             the status frame under 512 bytes and gets rid of annoying "Info string 
             length exceeded" messages. I don't think these needed to be serverinfo vars anyway.

             Fixed Cmd_Time_f function.  Originally commented out, I blindly recovered it for use.
             I must confess I didn't do the homework right away.  _strtime is non-portable. Fixed
             the glaring error with ANSI C time() and ctime() calls instead. Now it even prints the
             day, date and time real purty-like.

03/11/2004 - Fixed bugs in time functions. They used gi.bprintf() and this broadcasts too all
             users... oops.  Use gi.cprintf() instead.  It's not a bug, it's a feature.  
             I might consider creating a broadcast version of the time commands later.  
             Maybe something like "It's <timedate> at the <servername> server, but it's 
             <clienttime> at <playername>'s and there's only <minutes> left
             in this match".  With appropriate spam limiting, of course.

03/13/2004 - Replaced some player obituary texts.  
             Fixed some spelling and tried to add a little humor.

03/17/2004 - Set a hard coded floor of 1 and ceiling of 10 trackers in the tracker limiter. 
             It was possible to set huge tracker limits on rcon and lag the server.
             
             Reset tracker initial damage to zero.  Setting it to 10 caused lag when 
             a bunch of them died all at once.
             
             Fixed up some more text formatting in obituary texts.

03/20/2004 - Increased damage radius of vacuum maker by 20% (1000 -> 1200) and 
             increased damage to 250. 
             Doubled Kamikaze damage from 300 to 600.

             Released as Version 1.12.1.

03/20/2004 - Version 1.12.2 commences.
             Decreased damage from 1000 to 500 on homer rockets.
             More messing with obituary texts.

03/23/2004 - Released 1.12.2

03/27/2004 - Spell-checked help (man) text.
             Reorganized Cmd_Help function.

04/03/2004 - Split guided, homing and guided nuke rockets into separate files.

04/22/2004 - Added code for addition of floating mine launcher to inventory when player
             picks up a grenade launcher.

05/29/2004 - Fixup nuke, guided nuke, guided rocket classnames.  Enabled angel of mercy
             to catch nukes.  Still working on guided grabs. When angelom catches an eligible
             projectile it calls G_FreeEdict on that entity and this blows the logic of the
             guided rockets and guided nukes leaving the player who fired the guided rocket
             in the floor or somewhere in limbo. The only way to unlock it is to command kill.
             Keeping the class names distict for each weapon takes care of a lot of interaction
             issues with angels and trackers and whatnot.

             Fix for Floating Mine Launcher select. Users need to change bind in bindings.cfg 
             for grenade launcher to read:
             alias grenadelauncher5 "use double impact;wait;bind 6 grenadelauncher6"
             alias grenadelauncher6 "use floating mine launcher;wait;bind 6 grenadelauncher1"

05/31/2004 - Released 1.12.3 for Windows and Linux.

06/13/2004 - Re-release of rebuilt LOX 1.12.3 for Windows and Linux.

06/19/2004 - Coded configurable limit for floating mines.  Default limit is seven
             mines.  Set maxfloatingmines in server config to change.  Maximum allowed
             per player is hard coded at 10, minumum is 1.

06/26/2004 - Denial of Service bug found by Tommy<WOS>. Can crash server every time 
             under certain conditions. Affects all versions of LOX prior to 1.12.4.

             Fixed angelom code that had test code in it that printed diagnostic messages
             in 1.12.3 release of the mod.

             Defined manifest constants for darKMajick grenade types.

             Allow floating mine launcher to fire most kinds of darKMajick grenades.
             FML now works with all grenades except the teleport grenades, if you're
             holding teleports, it launches normal grenades instead.

             Released 1.12.4 for Windows and Linux. 

06/30/2004 - Version 1.12.5 commences. 
             Added Angel of Energy.
             
             Divided angels into their own source files to make maintenance a little
             easier (I hope). Now we can pull an angel if we don't need it anymore or
             modify it without scrolling through a long file to find it.
             Added function prototypes and constants to angels.h
             Modified all other modules that refer to angels to include angels.h.
             Added AngelOE and AngelOU help text. 
             
             Improved HOOK help text, added a description of the binds you need to 
             write to make it work. This helps oldtimers tell newbs to the mod how 
             to do the bind. This is a FAQ, so now users can say "type 'man hook' 
             at the console" and the server will explain it for them.

07/02/2004 - Modified the angels quite a bit. Angel of Revenge now depletes other
             players health by 50% while in contact with the opponent until their
             health is reduced to about 25 points. This even works against regeneration
             holders.  
             
             Angel of Mercy or Angel of Revenge deflect the Angel of Revenge.

             Angel of Unfreeze or Angel of Mercy deflects the Angel of Frost.

             Angel of Plague rapidly depletes your opponent's health until
             he has only 10 health points left, making him an easy kill. The
             range of the angel is 100 quake units. Flying the Angel of Life
             gives immunity to plague. Plague rate of decay is set at 5 health 
             points per client cycle.

             Being cloaked does not hide you from any angels.

07/04/2004 - Freeze grenade modified.  It now inflicts damage directly on the
             target on detonation.

             Fixed up GuidedRocket_Explode function to simply call Grenade_Explode_dM()
             for explosion effects. Now all the darKMajick grenades are maintained in
             one place.

08/20/2004 - Removed durgsweeper.

08/30/2004 - Added Kaminit, super rail shotgun, and disruptor trackers.
             Fixed up a lot of code and headers.

09/04/2004 - Adding map voting to allow players to elect a new map instead of depending
             on admins to use the RCON command.

09/12/2004 - Fixed up some manipulations of cvars.
             Perfected map voting and documented electpercentage, 
             electduration, electreminders.
             Bounds checks for these variables so we don't do silly things.
             Sanity check of linux Makefile to be sure we can still build it right.

09/14/2004 - Compiled under Linux, fixed up EOL's in files as needed.
             Nice clean compile under Linux now, fixing up warnings in VC6 @ W4.
             Need to check guided missiles, weaker damage actually increases health
             of targets at long ranges. Kinda cool, need to find out why though.

09/19/2004 - Added cvar campertime, default value 5 second timeout for anticamper.

10/18/2004 - Found a bug that was causing cloak to be ineffective against homers/skippers.
             In rockets.c the line if((blip->cloaked == 1) || (blip->oldmodel == 1)) continue;
             was: if(blip->cloaked == 1 || blip->oldmodel == 1) continue;
             WAY too subtle!

10/23/2004 - Fixed angelom vs. guided missiles. Angel of mercy now successfully defends
             against guided rockets without sending the POV of the guided rocket owner
             into the floor or some other weird space.
             Changed sound file for kaminit or kamikaze to play kamikaze.wav.

10/26/2004 - Fixed angelom vs. guided nuke bug.
             Fixed a lingering map voting bug. Server would crash if a non-existant map
             passed the vote. Map would not change, but intermission would crash it.

10/28/2004 - Fixed freeing of angel edicts on player death.

10/29/2004 - 1.12.5 Released for use on Loxophilia and later for the rest of world.

11/14/2004 - Begin LOX 1.12.6 codebase. Version 1.12.5 will probably never be released
             beyond its test use on Loxophilia.
             Changed all wepban and featureban logic in order to fix float/int conversion
             problems long since described in the the notes.txt. Created several i_vars
             that contain the int-converted strings received by the game and stored in the 
             cvars as floats and string members. Now the game checks ints against ints
             without casts and all the attendant overhead. See UpdateBans() for info.
             
11/20/2004 - Changed default maxentities to 2048 (g_save.c).

11/23/2004 - Changed map vote logic to stop spamming. A player can only initiate two
             map votes in a session by default. Server admins can configure the cvar 
             electstarts to allow from 1 to 6 election starts per player. 
             Added veto power for a single no vote.
             Clipped out YES/NO vote updates, too many updates when everyone is voting.
             Now it updates on the timer. Player voting doesn't increase the frequency.
             Voting stops on veto or when a winning vote is mathematically impossible.
             After observation of 1.12.6 on Loxophilia, changed maxentities back to 1024.

11/27/2004 - Added a mapchange and timestamp to the log at intermission time. (EndDMLevel)

11/28/2004 - Fixed superblaster sweeper that was using 0 damage and not fragging.
             Started splitting out some of the LOX weapons into their own files to get
             rid of some of these tiresome big weapon files.

12/04/2004 - Added 6 second timer to decoy code to prevent spamming of decoys.

12/09/2004 - Modified MaplistNext function to scan for stock maps and for existence
             of map file when using maplists. This will prevent server crash if the
             bsp file called for in the maplist.txt file doesn't exist. The new function
             skips that line in the maplist and tries the next one and logs the event.
             
             Tweaked weapon heat parameters for all sweepers. Created manifest constants
             for WEPHEAT_HIGH, WEPHEAT_LOW and WEPHEAT_COOLING to control the time constants.
             Sweepers heat up and blow the shooter kamikaze-style in both low speed and 
             high speed sweeper fire modes. This should allow firing bursts of 
             sweepers long enough to be effective but still discourage continuous 
             sweeper firing in unlimited ammo mode.

12/12/2004 - Modified skipper and homing rockets to allow them to betray owner if
             he's not careful. The rockets will home in on uncloaked enemies but
             if the owner becomes a more tempting target they will start to home in
             on him instead.

             Angel of flame deflects frost. Angel of frost deflects flame.

             Fixed weapon pickups so dropped weapons all get picked up as the weapon
             they were when the fragged player dropped them.

             Angel of life will ignore base weapons if they are banned. It used to
             fly off orbit and go off into space. Now you have to run over the weapon
             to get the LOX weapons if the basic quake2 weapon is banned.

             Release Version 1.12.6 This marks the one year anniversary since
             QwazyWabbit began work on WOD:LOX.

12/17/2004 - Fixed conflict between rangefinder and CTF HUD variables and tokens. Now
             the game correctly displays CTF icons and scores.
             Added rangefinder to HUD in CTF Extinction.
             Set CTF cloaking colors to red and blue so players can tell each other
             apart when cloaked. Need orange glow for invulnerability?
             Fixed lightning gun effect on grappling hook chain in CTF mode.
             Fixed OnSameTeam function to properly handle skin teams and CTF teams.

12/22/2004 - Added skinlist command. This lists the player's skins by client number
             for all players in the game. I added this to get around the fact that
             R1CH's R1Q2 client hack kills the skins command in that version of the
             client.

12/26/2004 - Fixed the tracker lock bug at last.

12/27/2004 - 1.12.6 Version tagged for release for Linux and Windows.

12/30/2004 - Fixed up HUD, now using manifest constants in strings so game can keep
             the messgages straight without a lot of programmer work. Created a
             unified initialization function for the HUD in all modes. 
             FPM, Rangefinder, Height and playerid toggles all survive across respawns.
             Eliminated redundant HUD functions in CTF code.
             Changed FPM to FPH. (Frags per Hour)
             Made ext_devt cvar to enable users to use the lasertrips to get point locationals
             for extinction map ents and weapon placements. The old way used a compile-time
             define to create a special build for it. This provides a runtime switch anyone
             can use.

01/14/2005 - Fixed cheats testing in coop mode. Disallow cheat commands if we're in coop mode
             and the cheats flag is not set.
             Fixed several different server-crashing bugs in coop mode.

01/16/2005 - LOX Version 1.12.7 Released.

02/08/2005 - Fixed several instances of gi.multicast calls that didn't have gi.writebyte calls
             first. This was causing r1q2 to crash with "SV_Multicast: no data" fatal errors. Good
             catch by r1q2, but fatal errors are no fun. The calls in LOX were due to programmers
             commenting out some lines and failing to comment out the gi.multicast calls with them.
             Apparently there are quite a few mods out there with this kind of error because there
             were several complaints about servers running r1q2 getting this error. R1ch said he's
             going to log this error and make it non-fatal in newer releases (b4449 crashes).

02/19/2005 - Changed voting function to use gamemap command instead of map command
             for r1q2 compatibility.
             
02/23/2005 - Floating mines stop glowing when they stop moving. This makes the napalms, plasmas
             and other DarKMajick types harder to see and avoid.

02/28/2005 - IP addresses of say and say_team commands are logged in Linux and Windows.

03/02/2005 - Fixed vote map command to disallow .bsp in command to avoid extra .bsp being
             added to the map name. The mod automatically appends .bsp to the name. If
             it's passed to the server with two extensions the server will crash.

03/09/2005 - Sniper trackers would launch and track but didn't fire on targets. Fixed.

03/14/2005 - Added a 45 second time delay after a level change before the game
             will accept a vote command from a client. This prevents map vote
             cheating where someone could force a vote before all the players
             are reconnected. Using the gamemap command and r1q2ded closes the
             cheat window nicely, but this ensures servers that don't run
             r1q2ded aren't vulnerable.

03/17/2005 - Filter some chars, like /, \, ; and . in vote map commands to prevent 
             server crashing due to malicious user input causing map not found errors.
             Still need to revisit this and make sure we catch all bogus chars.

03/19/2005 - Created CN_* classnum values for determining weapon/entity class numbers
             instead of doing string compares on classnames.

03/25/2005 - Modfied UpdateBans function to allow the function to be called in the server
             loop so a weapon ban will be activated immediately when it's changed via
             an rcon command instead of on the next map change.

             Added the homerseekowner cvar so admins can turn off the owner-homing
             feature of homing rockets and skippers if they like. The default state is 1
             (on) so current admins don't have to do anything to maintain existing LOX, setting
             it to 0 disables the owner-seek and the rockets behave as they did in 
             version 1.12.4 and earlier.

             Added LogPlayerStats function. Player & map information is logged for
             statistics collection. Setting logstats 0 turns it off.

05/04/2005 - Fixed LogPlayerStats so it doesn't print disconnected players in the summary.
             Started adding ARSG compatible output for statistics logging.

05/07/2005 - Finished ARSG logging function and documented means of death. Three
             logging modes: logarstats 0 means no statistics logging (default mode), 1 writes 
             a lox/arsg.log file, 2 puts the statistics into the qconsole stream.

05/10/2005 - Fixed MaplistNext function. Map selection now handles blank lines in
             the maplist.txt file and won't stick on the last good map. If changing maplist
             file contents on a 'hot' server the maplist variable will wrap back to 1
             if it was pointing past the end of the revised maplist file.

             Fixed vote map logic. Game now checks to see if the map exists before
             it starts a vote on it. Warns the player who initiated the vote if the
             map name can't be found on the server. Voting now prints the YES/NO votes
             when the vote passes or fails. Added code to prevent new joining players
             from initiating a map vote less than 45 seconds after they join the game.

05/12/2005 - Fixed output format specification in ARSG logging to add leading zeros
             to the time/date fields.

05/24/2005 - Changed sign of roll angle in jetpack. It now rolls in direction of 
             strafe instead of opposite.

05/27/2005 - Fixed door_blocked bug. A blocked door could pass a NULL activator to the
             G_UseTargets function when blocked by a player. This caused server to crash.
             Modified door_blocked function to use ent->enemy as activator if ent->activator
             is NULL. This should prevent a null activator from being passed into G_UseTargets.
             Enhanced the G_UseTargets function to print diagnostics to log so map developers
             can know which entity to fix.

06/05/2005 - Used X7's loxtestmap to check spawn functions of all weapons and items. Fixed
             a lot of missing spawns in the grenades and weapons.
             Fixed voting yet again. New players can't initiate vote for 45 seconds after
             joining a game in progress unless they are the only player. A player who joins
             a game where a vote is already in progress can't vote for that election, he is
             not counted in the head count for the duration of the election. This prevents
             reconnect cheating on the votes.

06/12/2005 - Drop cells on death when holding blaster or superblaster.

             Partially fixed NULL ent->think bug, server now logs the event but doesn't crash.

             Expanded the information that is logged for diagnostic purposes.
             (SV_RunThink in g_phys.c) Still need to find the real cause of this but I suspect
             we have some map bugs as well as G_FreeEdict() sync problems. Perhaps related to
             angelom or angeloe freeing entities that still need think cycles? In any case
             the server won't just crash.

             Made jetpack droppable. One interesting feature, dropping jetpack while flying
             keeps you flying. Pick up the dropped jetpack and get a new fuel load.

06/17/2005 - Fixed guided missile entity so it uses bazooka grenade instead of head gib.
             Use dM grenade glow too. Created SetGrenadeEffects function so even bazooka
             sweeper could use them if we wanted. (not sure this is a good idea)
             
             Fixed dM grenade functions to use separate dmg and dm_type to fix unknown 
             grenade type bug that arose from using dmg to contain the dm grenade type.
             I think the grenade functions still need some good cleaning, but this can
             be done as the grenades are improved.

             The shrapnel grenade now inflicts damage and radius damage consistent with
             the size and scope of its explosion.

06/21/2005 - Fixed CTF spectator no-pitch bug.
             Fixed CTF spectator visible bug.

06/21/2005 - Fixed laser sight glow.

06/26/2005 - Added respawn_protect cvar, allow server admin to control how much time
             the respawn invincibility lasts. max. 6 secs.

06/30/2005 - Added g_nukes_takedamage and g_rockets_takedamage cvars to allow admins
             to control whether guided nukes or rockets can be shot down.

07/02/2005 - Fixed bad modelindex in PBM_FlameCloud2 function in x_fire.c causing 
             placeholder entities in the nuke explosions. Credit to Mr.BovineOrdure
             for spotting this.

07/04/2005 - Fixed bug in revenge factor. It was using i_featureban, not dmflags 
             and conflicted with FB_PUSHPULL. 

07/10/2005 - Added deployed Tracker and Turret HUD counters.
             Documented some of the HUD layout stuff so I don't have to keep
             figuring it out each time I go back to it.
             Use turretcount and trackercount to display them in the hud.

07/23/2005 - Added push/pull text so players know who push/pulled them.

08/01/2005 - Angel of Energy now protects against push/pull.

09/25/2005 - Fixed bug in lbinds where new connecting client would inherit old disconnected
             client's lbinds. Strings are initialized to null at client connect. User must
             initiate lbind commands after connection and they will persist thereafter.

             Fixed a server crash bug where a character string could kill the server.

             Re-arranged a BUNCH of fragban constants that were overlapping and not
             functioning due to borrowing from the weapon bans. There are only 32 bits
             in the fragban but we have 90+ MODs, can't ban them all, need to select from
             the most likely to be needed.

10/31/2005 - Minor fixups of lbind code. Using strncpy instead of memcpy, memcpy
             was putting garbage in. Protected against buffer overflow if malicious
             user decides to try long string inputs.

             Added a numeric readout to weapon heat bar.

11/05/2005 - Fixup weapon heat.

             Added player count to summary log stats at map end.

11/08/2005 - Fixed angelom and angeloe code to pick off guided nukes and missiles.
             Used this opportunity to make the two classes more identical in structure.

12/08/2005 - Fixup tracker and turret bug discovered by DontKillMe. Trackers were
             not retaining the grenade types when the owner switched grenade types
             and were following the change to the new type. Set the dm_type when the
             tracker/turret is spawned and use it instead of the owner's dM_grenade
             type.

12/09/2005 - Fixup vamp, regen and armor probabilities.

01/21/2006 - Set default maxclients and maxspectators to 12.

02/19/2006 - Fixed laser tripwires to despawn when player dies/respawns to keep
             the number of active tripwires per player down to the configured limit.

03/09/2006 - Decreased radius damage and damage radius on shrapnel grenades.

03/09/2006 - LOX Version 1.12.9 Released.

04/18/2006 - Refined voting functions a bit. Added a cvar electautoyes to allow
             admins to control whether vote initiator automatically votes yes or not.

             Deleted jetpack drop capability.

06/03/2006 - Added g_offworld.c based on Phlem's original off-world teleport
             test code and created a new spawn function for special off-world
             teleport pads. Still room for improvement but it works.

06/24/2006 - Added some output to the game init to log the size of 
             entity allocation when the server restarts.

             More work on off-world teleport code. String handling, catch
             format errors.

07/08/2006 - Added day/night cycle. Eliminated DF_DAYNIGHT. Added minlevel
             and modified usage of nightdaytime.

07/09/2006 - LOX 1.12.10 Released.

09/17/2006 - Fixed g_nukes_takedamage bug that caused server crash. Same fix applied
             to g_rockets_takedamage.

11/19/2006 - Fixed kamikaze and durg bugs where dead player can be shot for points
             or weapons. Bug only occurs where a player is killed but doesn't respawn
             immediately keeping his client struct linked to the dead player body.
             Rarely occurs in game but closed the hole anyway.

12/17/2006 - Added new scoreboard style. Set newscoreboard 1 in server.cfg
             to allow server to send it.

12/27/2006 - More scoreboard modification. Major reorganization of headers
             to trim the dependencies. Attempting to organize headers and
             source files to more loosely couple the modules. The goal is to
             create modules and headers that completely define a feature so
             that modifying or adding a new feature is simply a matter of
             adding the header and functions and interfacing to them with
             a few hooks in the commands, etc. No messing around with a huge
             master header. Modified Makefile for semi-automatic dependency 
             generation.

12/30/2006 - Added vote map next command. Cleaned up Maplist functions. 
             
01/05/2006 - Added duplicate mapname detection in maplist selection. The
             maplist selector now looks at the nextmap and the current
             map and skips to the second nextmap if the first would be 
             a duplicated run.

01/06/2006 - Fixed up ClientCommand, eliminated a local var and goto's.

02/07/2007 - Fixed infinite recursion on some buggy maps when using wall-piercing
             railgun. Stack overflow killed server.

02/16/2007 - LOX Version 1.12.12 Released

02/21/2007 - Fixed sticky grenades to allow player to move freely even with
             grenades stuck on him.

             Fixed vortex, airfist and mace to stop them from pushing/pulling
             power-ups and weapons around on the map. Might create a cvar to turn
             this off/on so "purists" who want the old ways can configure it.

06/11/2007 - Fixed airstrike hole. It was possible to command airstrike and then
             switch to a forbidden grenade type and airstrike would deliver it.

10/20/2007 - Fixed null pointer exception causing server crash if decoy was
             spawned into space where players would otherwise die and then the
             decoy was fired upon making him seek a target. 
             Bug reported by Don'tKillMe.

10/27/2007 - Fixed backpack bug where player would get excess items.

10/28/2007 - LOX Version 1.12.13 Released

11/11/2007 - Added auto-archive of stats logs never, daily, weekly, monthly. Set
             cvar statsfile_rename to 0, 1, 2, 3 for interval. The stats.log is
             automatically renamed to stats/YYYYMMDD-stats.log in game folder
             at midnight. Game default is daily. Cvar: statsfile_rename

11/22/2007 - Added auto-archive of server log never, weekly, monthly per cvar
             logfile_rename value. File is moved to ./logs/YYYYMMDD-qconsole.log
             at midnight. Game default is weekly. Cvar: logfile_rename

11/30/2006 - Fixed the improved flashlight. Old flashlight was hyperblaster glow.
             Improved flashlight used TE_FLASHLIGHT but beam would go off-axis
             and flicker when pointed at sky box through openings in ceilings.
             Bug reported by X7. Added new model "models/flight/tris.md2" for 
             aim point to get rid of red laser dot in beam in most clients.
             Added compile-time switch to select preferred flashlight style.

12/12/2007 - Added cvar staticlights. This allows admin to decide if the game
             will display the dynamic map lighting or freeze them at normal
             daylight levels. The old game froze them at 'm'. 
             Reference: SP_worldspawn in g_spawn.c CS_LIGHTS.
             Default is staticlights = 0, set 1 for static lighting. 
             Lighting mode changes on next map.

01/05/2008 - LOX Version 1.12.14 Released

05/04/2008 - Fixed feature bans on REGEN and VAMPIRIC health. Bans were not being
             tested in Touch_Item function. (g_items.c)

05/04/2008 - Added ammotype Wall Piercing Railgun to tracker and turret Think functions.
             They were getting the ammo type on deploy but not firing on targets.

05/17/2008 - Massive code cleanup for style and readability. Purely cosmetic.

12/29/2008 - Added monthly maplist rotation logic. Default load sense maplist files
             are now maplist_low.txt, maplist_med.txt, maplist_high.txt. Monthly maplist
             files are maplistNN.txt where NN = 01 thru 12. The rename was just 
             so when you list the directory by name they sort nicely.

xx/xx/xxxx - LOX Version 1.12.15 Released

xx/xx/xxxx - LOX Version 1.12.16 Released

03/30/2009 - Added variable control to probability of pickup for armors and regen.

10/02/2009 - Added Oakbot code.

10/02/2009 - Bitchy Boo (Benjamin) inspired addition of Nuke Grenade from Bang! mod.

07/19/2010 - Added intermission_maxtime cvar. This times out the server intermission
             after default 30 seconds. Allows players to idle and the map system will
             continue to rotate next map.

04/27/2013 - Added cvar initialization for max_cats. Fixed up case independent 
             string comparison functions and cleaned up the callers.

05/23/2013 - Global find/replace on if(, while( and for( 
             Replaced QTRUE and QFALSE with built-in true/false

08/31/2014 - Added cvar for enabling/disabling LOX's zbot check.

04/05/2015 - LOX version 1.12.18 Released.

11/03/2015 - QW is a bad boy and hasn't been keeping this document up to date
             Removed DF_REVENGE_FACTOR, DF_DAYNIGHT, DF_ANTICAMPER, 
             DF_HIGHFRAGGER, DF_WEAPONHEAT from DMFLAGS and made them cvars. 
             LOX Version 1.12.19.

03/09/2018 - Added givehook command. This gives the aliases the +hook
             command needs to operate. Player can now type givehook to the console
             and receive all the aliases needed to operate the hook.

             Fixed the rotation of the hyperblaster weapons. The default
             weapon select rotation wasn't correct, lightninggun, freezatron
             and disruptor weren't being selected.

             Moved the lightning gun into the hyperblaster class where
             it belonged per the docs. It was erroneously picking up 
             with the railgun.
             
             Mods to the help text per the changes.
             LOX Version 1.12.21

04/23/2021 - LOX version 1.12.23
             Added wall inspect command.

03/06/2023 - LOX version 1.12.24
             GCC versions 10 and later now set -fno-common by default.
             Declarations in headers need extern now and definition in
             the .c files where they're instantiated.
             Standardized on C17 and changed GNUmakefile.

TheLopez

06/22/2005 - Fixed lbind command. 
             Updated lines 95, 107, 120 to use G_CopyString instead 
             of a straight assignment. Verified fix.

06/24/2005 - Added sticky trackers (turrets).

06/25/2005 - Added anti-flare gun. When fired it will create an area that dark instead
             of lit up like the flare gun.

06/27/2005 - Added midnight grenade. Launches 12 anti-flares.

06/28/2005 - Added freezatron and freezatron grenades. The freezatron is like the positron
             except for the damage has been toned down and it will freeze you
             if it touches you. The longer it touches you the longer you will be
             frozen.

06/30/2005 - Added Banzai and Floating Rail Grenade. The two grenades are launched like
             normal but after landing on the ground they will rise up into
             the air and then fire their deadly payload. Banzai grenade will
             fire the same ammo as the kaminit and Floating Rail Grenade will
             fire a rail shot.

07/04/2005 - Prevent trackers/turrets from launching teleport or midnight grenades.
           - Updated rise rate and time for the Banzai and Floating Rail Grenades. They
             now take 0.3 seconds to rise to their appropriate heights.
           - Fixed bug that would cause Banzai and Floating Rail Grenades to float when
             fired by anything else than the grenade launcher.

07/06/2005 - Update spinning rail grenade to have a better rail shot distribution and speed
           - Update LBind commands, they will now persist between map loads. Before players
              would have to reset their LBinds after loading back into a map.

07/15/2005 - Updated and expanded airstrike. It will now use some of the selected dm 
             grenades. The airstrike strike location and speed is also now 
             randomized but it will hit in the general area of the lsight. Also 
             lsight is automatically turned on when the airstrike is called and 
             turned off if the airstrike is intercepted or when the airstrike 
             arrives.

07/20/2005 - Updated banzai grenades, they will now only fire 12 shots but those shots will
             target the nearest player.

08/01/2005 - Updated freezer grenades, they are launched like normal but after landing on 
             the ground they will rise up into the air and then fire 12 shots but those 
             shots will target the nearest player.

==============================================================================

Phlem
09/13/2004 - Changed spiral rocket model to gibs/head2/tris.md2

09/13/2004 - Changed rocket model to gibs/skull/tris.md2 in l_rocket.c

11/26/2004 - Updated kill messages in p_client.c:
             - new message text for most of the messages
             - "repair" of gender id on a couple of messages
             - Addition of stuff / say for two or three more death types

08/29/2005 - Added "offworld teleporter" syntaxt to enable interserver game transfer.

09/03/2005 - Added options entity loading at map load time.  (new file: g_ent.c)

_________________________________________________________________________________________________
Using GameCam 1.04 from Avi Rosen.  This is a transparent cascade proxy so it's
name is gamex86.dll and it lives in the directory of the mod we are playing.
Consequently the game mod dll gets renamed to gamex86.real.dll and the GameCam
loads this on initialization.  

Beware the post-build commands in the project.
The post-build commands copy the game dll to the working directory for debugging.
