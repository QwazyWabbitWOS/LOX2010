<p><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b>Greetings LOXers,</b><br>
<br>
LOX 1.12.7 is essentially 1.12.6 with fixes made for coop mode. There are no
changes to the weapon bans or DMFLAGS. The really big changes in that area were
made between 1.12.4 and 1.12.6. The 1.12.6 &quot;release&quot; was installed
and tested on Loxo with some limited distribution to X7 and Grasshopper for
testing in CTF server and deathmatch client modes. All the references in the
docs to 1.12.6 should probably be changed to 1.12.7 except for the version
history in the readme.txt file and I need to update that for the 1.12.7 changes.
Most of the changes between 1.12.6 and 1.12.7 are transparent to casual users.
The only &quot;visible&quot; change is the ext_devt console variable to allow a
developer to run the game in extinction development mode in order to survey the
maps and establish coordinates for locating ents in ent files for Extinction
mode. This was originally a compile-time definition and required a special build
of the DLL.<br>

<br>
</i></font></font><font color="#008000" face="Arial" size="2"><i>Note: LOX
cooperative mode is a new mode for LOX; the game was originally tested only in
Deathmatch mode but I have fixed some of the more obvious problems with it in
the 1.12.7 release but it has not be fully tested so there may be some interesting
things to find in there.<br>
<br>
</i></font><font face="Arial" size="2"><br>
1. Fixed conflict between rangefinder and CTF HUD variables and tokens. Now
&nbsp;the game correctly displays CTF icons and scores.<br>
<br>
2. Added rangefinder to HUD in CTF Extinction.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Set CTF cloaking colors to red
and blue so players can tell each other &nbsp;apart when cloaked. Need orange
glow for invulnerability?<br>
<br>
4. Fixed lightning gun effect on grappling hook chain in CTF mode.<br>
<br>
5. Fixed OnSameTeam function to properly handle skin teams and CTF teams.<br>
<br>
6. Added skinlist command. This lists the player's skins by client number&nbsp;for
all players in the game. I added this to get around the fact that&nbsp;R1CH's
R1Q2 client hack kills the skins command in that version of the&nbsp;client.<br>
<br>
7. Fixed up HUD, now using manifest constants in strings so game can keep&nbsp;the
messgages straight without a lot of programmer work. Created a&nbsp;unified
initialization function for the HUD in all modes.&nbsp;FPM, Rangefinder, Height
and playerid toggles all survive across respawns.<br>
<br>
8. Eliminated redundant HUD functions in CTF code.<br>
<br>
9. Changed FPM to FPH.<br>
<br>
10.Made ext_devt cvar to enable users to use the lasertrips to get point
locationals&nbsp;for extinction map ents and weapon placements. The old way used
a compile-time&nbsp;define to create a special build for it. This provides a
runtime switch anyone&nbsp;can use.<br>
<br>
11. Fixed cheats testing in coop mode. Disallow cheat commands if we're in coop
mode&nbsp;and the cheats flag is not set.<br>
<br>
12. Fixed several different server-crashing bugs in coop mode.<br>
<br>

<font color="#008000"><i>- RELEASED: December 19, 2004</i></font><br>
</font><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">
<br>
</font></span><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">1.</font></span><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2"> Extensive modification of weaponban and featureban constants  and cleanup of float/int conversion overflow problems. System<br>
  now uses unsigned ints instead of floats for weapon bans and  feature bans. The Lopez' Server Configuration Tool is now obsolete  as many weaponbans and feature bans changed values. The new  constants are listed in the server_readme.txt. The advantage of  all this is now all the individual weapon bans actually work. An  added benefit of the way the system gets the values it needs is  that the values can be decimal, octal or hexadecimal format.  (e.g.,12345, 0123, or 0x124af)</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">2. Added anti-spam logic to map voting module. Now players can only  initiate a map vote an admin-configured number of times in any one  match. The default is 2. Cvar electstarts controls this.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">3. Added 6 second timer to decoy command to prevent spamming.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">4. Improved maplist processing in the mod to check that the map file  can be found before passing the map change to the intermission  functions in the Q2 core. This prevents server crashes due to  typos in the maplist file or Upper/lower case sensitivity.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">5.</font></span><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2"> LOX now logs the date and time of map changes and player joins  in the qconsole.log if logging is enabled.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">6. Fixed weapon heat in sweeper code. Sweepers heat in all fire modes.  Admin can turn on dmflag DF_WEAPONHEAT to enable this feature.  Overheating your weapon causes it to blow up - and you with it.<br>
<br>
7. Angel of flame deflects angel of frost and angel of frost deflects  angel of flame. Frost will not un-flame you and flame will not<br>
  un-freeze you.</font></span></p>

<p align="left"><span class="postbody"><font face="Arial" size="2">8. Guided missile is now a skull gib. (Phlem&lt;WOS>)<br>
<br>
9. Spiral rockets are now head gibs. (Phlem&lt;WOS>)<br>
<br>
10. Many cool and funny obituary texts added by Phlem. Sometimes it's  hard not to just sit there and watch the texts roll by as the game  is played.<br>
<br>
11. Added green and gold versions of the pak1.pak file to the installation  package in order allow users to improve the readability of the game text.  As the game gets older, so do the players and their eyes.<br>
<br>
12. Added angel of energy.<br>
<br>
13. Modified many angel features. Separated the angel source files and  made many features and weapons more modular and atomic. Now weapons  can be added, deleted, modified without slicing up monsterous source  files.<br>
<br>
14. Improved hook help text. LOX hook is unique in that it has several binds  needed for extend, retract, etc. FAQ in the game is "how to hook?" Now  users can be told 'man hook' and server help text is displayed in console.<br>
<br>
15. Modifed angel of revenge and angel of plague to do more damage to opponents.<br>
<br>
16.&nbsp; Modified interaction of angels:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Angel of mercy and revenge deflect angel of revenge.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Angel of unfreeze or angel of mercy deflect angel of frost.<br>
<br>
17. Cloak does not hide you from angels.<br>
<br>
18. Removed durgsweeper. Causes server lag and crash when too many entities  are created too quickly. Durggun remains in inventory.<br>
<br>
19. Added kaminit, disruptor and railgun trackers. Launching trackers with  super rail shotgun in hand now launches rail trackers.<br>
<br>
20. Added map voting. Now users can select maps and majority wins the map  immediately changes. Now players don't have to beg admins for map
rcons.<br>
<br>
21. Source code now compiles cleanly on Windows VC++ 6.0 and Linux GCC with  minimal pragmas. VC set to warning level 4 (max.) and nice clean compiles.  Linux Makefile is maintained in sync with Windows project.<br>
<br>
21. Added cvar campertime, anticamper feature can now be enabled with admin  programmable time limits from 5 to 600 seconds.<br>
<br>
22. Fixed angel of mercy vs. guided missiles. This was a really old bug and took  a long time to debug and fix. Angel of mercy now successfully defends  against guided rockets without sending the POV of the guided rocket owner  into the floor or some other weird space.<br>
<br>
23. Kamikaze now uses kamikaze.wav, players now yell Banzai! when going kami.<br>
<br>
24. Fixed freeing of angle edicts on player death.<br>
<br>
25. CTF:LOX Extinction now works properly. Grappling hook is fixed, the  cloak is colored by team color, HUD is fixed, scoring display is fixed.<br>
<br>
26. The tracker lock bug is fixed at last.<br>
<br>

- Increased range of vacuum maker by 20% and increased damage.<br>
<br>
1.12&nbsp;<br>
- December 12, 2003, QwazyWabbit begins renewed development of WOD:LOX. This was  initially begun as an attempt to fix many of the worst bugs of LOX that made full  use of many of the features of WOD:LOX impossible. The new LOX has become an  attractive new mod on the good old Quake2 engine with new and better weapons and  features. The current development effort is directed at making LOX a stable and  full-featured mod that allows admins more control of the style of play they want<br>
  to see on their server. The Admin chooses the weapons and features he wants. This  allows him to make LOX a strategic and skillful game full of stealth, stalk and  accurate marksmanship, or a full-on fragfest of cataclysmic explosions, rapid-fire<br>
  streetsweepers and weapons of mass destruction.<br>
<br>
1.11 Summary by QwazyWabbit:<br>
- This release included darKMajick grenades and guided nukes and guided grenades.  Original source code that included these features was "lost". The binaries for  WOD:LOX 1.11 became the standard release most commonly found on game servers<br>
  but the mod languished undeveloped from September 1999 until December 2003.</font></span></p>

This is posted to the general LOX community so others may have input to the
process. &nbsp;If you have suggestions or code to contribute, please feel free
to post/link/upload them here. Links to code modules that can be adapted
to LOX are welcomed. &nbsp;It makes my task a lot easier if I have samples to
adapt. &nbsp;Improvements to the LOX documentation and config files, errata, are
