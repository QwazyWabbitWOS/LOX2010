PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS DOCUMENT BEFORE INSTALLING OR USING POSTNUKE



PostNuke: The Phoenix Release (0.7.5.0)
=======================================

   PostNuke is an open source, open developement content management system
(CMS).  PostNuke started as a fork from PHPNuke (http://www.phpnuke.org) and
provides many enhancements and improvements over the PHP-Nuke system.  PostNuke
is still undergoing development but a large number of core functions are now
stabilising and a complete API for third-party developers is now in place.

New Installation
================

   PostNuke has a fully graphical install process to provide a simple set of
steps to get your site up and running. 

   Prior to running the installer ensure that both config.php and config-old.php
are world writable. Further ensure that pnTemp and it's subdirectories are also 
world writable. World writable means a permission setting of 777 or 666 depending 
on your system if the system is unix based.

   To install your PostNuke system run install.php from your browser to start
the installation process.  The exact url depends on your site, but for example
if your site is www.foo.com and PostNuke is installed in the 'bar' directory
then the URL will be

   http://www.foo.com/bar/install.php

   Follow the instructions in the installation script and when prompted for
either a new install or an upgrade select 'new install'.  The installer will
create the required database tables and obtain information about the super-user
login.  Once complete you should be able to start using your PostNuke site
immediately.

Note: it is important to remember in the case of new installs, that are also to create 
the database, that the mysql user, most have full rights to create new databases, if not
then first create the database and grant the intended mysql user full rights to it, so 
that it becomes possible for the installer and modules to interact freely, with the new
database and work correctly.
   
   PostNuke now supports the new php 4.2.x+ security standard of
register_globals turned off and Apache 2.0.x.

ADDENDUM: For those that asked the mysql dump has been included if you use this
instead of the installer then take note that the admin user is: "Admin" and its
password is "Password", both case sensitive.

In order to install PostNuke this way you need to have shell access to your server
and issue the following commands.

mysqladmin create your_db_name -p

Then:

mysql your_db_name<Phoenix-0.7.5.0.sql

That will load the sql to your newly created database and you can visit your new
portal, please remember to change the Admin password.

This way of installing is not recommended since if you forget to make this password
name you would leave you system open to attacks.
So please just use as a last resort.


Upgrade
=======

   PostNuke supports upgrading from all earlier official versions of PostNuke,
together with a large number of other Nuke variants.

   Before doing anything else, BACK UP YOUR DATABASE AND FILES.  This cannot be 
stressed enough.  If there is a problem with the upgrade procedure then a backup 
helps you in two ways.  First, you can go back to a pre-upgrade state and your 
site can keep working on the old code.  Second, the development team might want 
to get a copy of your database to trace the exact problem and fix the upgrade
procedures that caused you problems in the first place.

   Second, ensure that your default site theme or the theme for your admin user 
(if allowing user theme overrides) is set to ExtraLite. All other themes in this
release are Xanthia themes that require initialisation from the Admin panel.

   Third, take a copy of your config.php file and store it somewhere safe;
you'll need it in a minute.

   Fourth, If your uprgrading from a earlier release candidate or from an earlier
release with XTE installed then ensure that all cache and compile directories in 
pnTemp are emptied.

   Firth, remove all of the files in your PostNuke distribution.  All of them.
Again a backup of the files would be a good idea, or just move the old
directory out of the way and install the new one in place of this one.

   Sixth, take your config.php that you saved a couple of steps ago and copy
it to the postnuke base directory (the one with config.php and config-old.php).
This will be used in the upgrade process

While you are at this step make sure you set permissions for the config-old.php
and config.php to 777 or 666 depending on your system. 

This is needed in order to allow php to update this files, after installation is
over please change this permissions to 644.

   Seventh, There are also several new entries in config.php that need adding.
Add the following to just below $pnconfig['encoded']

$pnconfig['pconnect'] = '0';
$pnconfig['temp'] = 'pnTemp';

and add the following just below $pndebug['debug_sql']      = 0;

$pndebug['pagerendertime'] = 0;

   Eighth, run install.php from your browser to start the installation process.
The exact url depends on your site, but for example if your site is www.foo.com
and PostNuke is installed in the 'bar' directory then the URL will be

   http://www.foo.com/bar/install.php

   Follow the instructions in the installation script and when prompted for
either a new install or an upgrade select 'upgrade', then pick the version of
PostNuke (or another Nuke variant) which you wish to upgrade from.  The rest of
the procedure should be automatic.

Once installation is complete you will need to re-add your custom modules and 
regenerate from the modules admin. As part of the upgrade some modules may be
ugraded. From the modules admin Upgrade and re-activate any modules require it.


Caution
=======

   Previous versions of PostNuke and other derivatives often include plugins
that alter the database core tables through adding fields, changing names, etc.
It should be noted that PostNuke does not support any modification of the core
tables (those that come with this PostNuke distribution) or direct access to
the core database tables.  APIs are provided for developers to use for these
purposes, so that future planned changes will have a minimal impact on
third-party added functionality, and should be used at all times.


Common Installation Errors
==========================

   config.php and config-old.php not world-writable - these files need to be
writable by the webserver process during the install/upgrade to ensure that
certain configuration parameters are stored.  The install procedure should
check for this and inform you if the files are not writable.  Note that once
the install/upgrade has been completed these files can be re-set to read-only.

   Problems creating or populating the datbase  - this is often due to
incorrect MySQL privileges on the database.  If you are unsure if this might be
the case then try to access your MySQL database manually with the username and
password that you have and attempt to create a database and table to ensure
that the user exists, has a correct password, and is able to carry out the
operations that PostNuke needs for installation.

   Problems logging in - this is normally due to access the postnuke site with
an unqualified host name e.g. http://localhost/index.php or a domain name e.g.
http://foo.com/index.php  PostNuke requires that the site name is
fully-qualified e.g. http://www.foo.com/index.php  Instructions on setting up a
fully-qualified hostname for your local server can be found on the PostNuke
documentation site at http://docs.postnuke.com  Alternatively you can set the
'intranet' option when installing or upgrading PostNuke, which will allow you
to run PostNuke without a fully-qualified domain name but without the ability
to filter cookies from similar domains.  In most cases where PostNuke is run
like this it should not be an issue, however setting your site to run as an
intranet site when it is directly connected to the internet is not recommended.

Enjoy!
