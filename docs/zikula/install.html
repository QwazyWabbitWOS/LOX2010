<h2 id="AB">1. Zikula: The adam_baum Release</h2>
<p>Zikula is an open source, open development application framework for dynamic websites.
The core system includes a complete API on which third party developments can build.  
Zikula has a very strong community, which provides a large number of extensions to the 
system and a helpful support centre in the <a href="http://community.zikula.org/module-Forum.htm" title="The Zikula Forums">forums</a>.</p>

<p>We welcome contributions from anyone, regardless of skill level.  
<a href="http://community.zikula.org/module-Pages-display-pid-6.htm" title="Contribute to the Zikula project">How you can help us</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Server">2. Server Consideration</h2>
<p>Before you begin, there are some requirements and guidelines you should consider to make installing, running, and securing Zikula easier. Please read the <a href="softwarerecommendations.html">Zikula software recommendations document</a>.</p>
<h2 id="New">3. New Installation</h2>
<p>There are two installation methods for Zikula:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href="#Graph">Graphical Browser Install</a></li>
	<li><a href="#Manual">Manual SQL Dump Install</a></li>
</ul>


<h3 id="Graph">Graphical Browser Install</h3>
<p>To use the installer, simply visit install.php in the Zikula directory with your
browser, e.g. <em>http://www.example.com/install.php</em>.  If you installed Zikula into a subdirectory 'foo' the URL would be 
<em>http://www.example.com/foo/install.php</em>.</p>

<p>The installer provides you with instructions on the way.  Zikula require a database
to be created at some point and it can save problems later if this is created by you 
<em>before</em> the install script is run.  While it is possible for the Zikula installer to
attempt to create the database, this will not always be successful as you will require 
greater access rights to the database.  In most hosted environments this is not available so you must 
create databases through an administration control panel.  If you do this, note down 
the database name, username and password for use in the installation.</p>

<p>Once the installation process is complete, you can visit your Zikula website by navigating to index.php, e.g. <em>http://www.example.com/index.php</em>.  
In the vast majority of cases, this will open automatically when typing <em>http://www.example.com</em> into your browser.</p>


<h3 id="Manual">Manual SQL Dump Install (Not recommended)</h3> 
<p>If you wish to import the SQL dump to install Zikula manually, this can be done through a
tool such as phpMyAdmin.  The dump provided is from a MySQL 5.x database, and may not work
with other databases, or MySQL versions.  Once you have imported the SQL dump, you should manually
edit config/config.php and add the appropriate database connection details in the area reserved for the
'default' connection.  The values for username and password should be base64 encoded for added security
(encoders are freely available on the Internet).  Should you install in this manner, the administration
login username is "admin" with password "Password" (without the quotes).</p>


<h2 id="Final">4. Final Note</h2>
<p>Modifications to the Zikula core system code or database are not supported.  Doing so can cause 
extensive problems when upgrading the system in the future and therefore these 'hacks' are not
recommended.  Zikula has a flexible extensions system and configuration override system to allow
customization and we recommend you consult the <a href="http://community.zikula.org/Wiki-tag-DeveloperDocs.htm">developer documentation</a> about this.</p>

<p>We hope you enjoy using this release of Zikula.</p>

<p>Regards,<br />

The Zikula Team</p>
