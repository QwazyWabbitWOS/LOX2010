PostNuke Phoenix .750 Gold Release Credits
==========================================

PostNuke is, as with many successful open-source products, a huge
collaborative effort spanning many diverse talents from across the 
globe.  The list below gives an idea of some of the people that have 
helped in creating the PostNuke Phoenix .750 Gold Release, and also
those in other areas such as support and documentation.

   PostNuke was originally a fork of PHPNuke by Francisco Burzi, and many of
the concepts in that program survive even though the code does not.  We (and
PHPNuke, of course) were also influenced by earlier products such as slash and
thatware, and I'm sure that we could trace the lineage back to the earliest
weblog if we wanted to.  Open source at work is taking the best ideas floating
around the web and building a product out of them, and that's where we hope
that PostNuke is heading.

Please note that this credits file only contains credits relevant to
the .750 Gold release of PostNuke.  For full credits, please refer 
to the file docs/previouscredits.txt. For credits of the many third party 
applications and tools used to build PostNuke please refer to the file
docs/thirdpartycredits.txt

Thanks also go to the many translation teams around the world who

truly multi-national project, with contributions from around the
world.
