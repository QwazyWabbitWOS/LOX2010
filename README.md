### This is WOD:LOX 1.12.x A Quake 2 mod ###

* LOX Lethal Orfice eXaminination is derived from Weapons of Destruction.
* With enhanced weapons and incorporates features from WOD, Chaos, BoTS, CTF, LMCTF and other mods, the purpose of this mod was to see just how amped up a mod could get. In 1998 it was pretty intense.
* The original code was v1.10 and it was pretty instable as a server. When I took it up my main goal was to stabilize the code and fix the bugs that would crash the server. The current version is practically self-managing, requiring very little attention by the server operator. Log files are archived at midnight and maplists can be rotated on a monthly schedule so the only thing a server operator needs to do is check the archived logs and purge them occasionally when he feels he no longer needs them.
