		LoX Server Command Summary
        ==========================

// These commands can be set using the +set command line arguments
// or they can be set in a config file. I find it best to set them
// in the configuration files and to keep 3 different files for the
// modes. This allows me to set different host names and other parameters
// for each of the modes.

set logarstats 0|1|2 // default 0, 1 causes LOX to log ARSG compatible data to

					 // console and to the qconsole.log file.

// Note: Numbers can be entered as decimal, hexadecimal or octal numbers depending
//	  on the format used. This follows the "C" convention: 123 is decimal,
//	  0x123 is hex, 0123 is octal. This can be handy for weapon ban variables
//	  since it might be easier to enter a number as 0xf00 than to do the math
//	  and enter it as decimal 3840. In octal this would be 07400. This is merely
//	  a notational convenience.
//
//	  Many console variables don't show in the variable lists displayed by
//	  game scanners. The size of the status packet is limited by Q2 design
//	  therefore the list of exposed variables has to be kept short.
